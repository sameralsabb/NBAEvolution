# NBAHeights

This project was done to see the evolution of the NBA since its inception in 1946. There were four questions that were asked in order to find out how the NBA has evolved:

* What rule changes have influenced the NBA?

* How have NBA Players physically evolved since the inception of the league?

* How has the Evolution of Player Body Measurements and NBA Rule Changes impacted who wins the MVP?

* Does team perfermance change based on cap utilized?

Data was acquired from various websites such as:

* www.basketball-reference.com/
* www.basketball.realgm.com/
* www.spotrac.com/nba/
* www.stats.nba.com/

Data was scraped using Beautiful Soup and also read into the Python file from JSON, HTML and CSV files.
